# Contributing

Fish Fight aims to be a highly contributor-friendly game. If you haven't already, please take some time to read the [community guidelines](code_of_conduct.html).

#### [Development Tracks](https://github.com/fishfight/FishFight/issues/124)

Our *Tracks* are ongoing projects with one or more leads. Some are permanent (e.g. Items or Editor) while others are temporary (e.g. Special Tiles or Physics). These are the recommended jumping-on points for new contributors.

#### Fields of contribution

Games are a synthesis of many different talents. Like most games, we're starting out code-heavy as we're building out the core functionality. Thanks to our deep focus on modding however, over time we expect contributions like level editing or pixel remixing to be even more plentiful and diverse than the field of coding.

## Code ðŸ’»

If you're interested in making a change that will involve hacking on the game's source code, we have a quick reference on how to get started at [Contributing Code](./contributing_code.md)!

## Pixels ðŸŽ¨

There are three primary types of art assets in Fish Fight:

- Items
- Tiles & Objects
- Characters

Soon to be a proper book page:

Any of our items labeled [art-needed](https://github.com/fishfight/FishFight/labels/art-needed) are missing an art asset.

## Audio ðŸŽ¶

### SFX

Right now the easiest way in is to create new SFX for an [item](https://github.com/fishfight/FishFight/labels/item).
